# Possible future improvements

 - Allow configuring `sqlite3` database file path.
 - Rather than decrementing the number of items when one is purchased it could
 be implemented as a ledger so that we know when items came out stock.
 - Allow the quantity of each gift to be specified.
 - Test what happens when we attempt to purchase an item out of stock.
 - Allow searching products by brand, price or availability.
